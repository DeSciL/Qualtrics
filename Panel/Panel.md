# Qualtrics Panels

Integration with Qualtrics is built on a simple code-sharing procedure. Respondents access the survey by click on a link. The link has an embedded access code (password). After having completed the survey or experiment, an exit code (redemption code) is displayed on the last page. The worker has to transfer this exit code with copy and paste to Amazon Mechnical Turk. This procedure is very robust and easy to understand for turkers.
